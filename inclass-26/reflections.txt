I really enjoy the Game Assignment. It gives me a very good chance to practice writing more javascripts. I think it helps me understand javascripts more deeply. I like it. What's more, final project Ricebook is really cool.

Also, React is cool. Cool kids use that. I feel React is helpful. I like the way Professor Scott divides the course/large project into small pieces and we can solve problems in each piece separately.

Test Driven Programming is also the key I learned in this class. I will take it in my future programming. Separation of Concerns is also useful.

MongoDB and mongoose are also something I feel useful that I learned in this class. Basically, I think I love all the materials you taught us.

One thing I think it could be better is that you could spend less time in introducing us technology we will not use in class. Instead, you could use that time to hand on hand teaching us how to do in class assignments. I think doing things help us learn more. It is better to finish in class assignments in class with your help. Probably you could code on screen and we can follow step by step. Because some concepts take us a long time to figure it out without extra helping. This benefits students more.

One more thing is to make this class a 4 or 5 credits one. It is definitely not a 3 credits course. LOL

Thank you very much and I enjoy taking your course.
